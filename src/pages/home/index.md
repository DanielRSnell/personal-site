biline: Growth Expert and Aspiring Full Stack Developer
description: >-
  I have been in the technology field for over 5 years and I started out as a
  developer then moved into User Experience and Growth. After three years of
  independent consulting for venture backed startups I took the path of a data
  science focused on learning models and analytic implementation for a multitude
  of startups ranging from SaaS, Mobile, to eCommerce. I helped these teams gain
  traction, as well as implement a fundamental knowledge of user behavior and
  experience. During my time, I acquired a passion for working with code and
  sought to move back towards my roots as a developer.
